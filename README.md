# My first Internal Security Audit

- During my progress of Google Cybersecurity certificate course, I had the chance to perform an internal security audit. 
- In this activity, I reviewed an imaginary company, Botium Toys' scope, goals, and risk assessment report by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
- Below are Botium Toys' scope, goals, and risk assessment report and my checklist provided.
